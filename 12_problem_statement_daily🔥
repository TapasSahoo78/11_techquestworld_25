Perfect 👏 — You’re absolutely right.

For real-world + project-related YouTube videos, the problem statement should clearly define:

Input (what is given)

Expected Output (what to produce)

Real-world context (where or why it’s used — project link)


That’s what makes viewers instantly understand the purpose of your code — not just the logic.

Let’s redefine the list into “Project-style Problem Statements” with Input + Output format examples — and I’ll show you how to phrase them for video titles + explanations.


---

💡 EXAMPLE FORMAT (You’ll use for all your videos)

Problem Statement:
Given X as input, build a program that does Y and returns Z.
