📅 Strategy Suggestion (for YouTube)

Upload daily or 3x per week.

Alternate between JavaScript and Python.

Keep format consistent:

Hook (5 sec): “Today we’ll solve a real-world problem — [problem title].”

Explain (1 min): Problem and logic.

Code (2–3 min): Full coding with comments.

Wrap (30 sec): Output + next video teaser.

Would you like me to now:

1. 📘 Write Problem #1 (Compound Interest) full script (with explanation + code + voiceover lines)?
or


2. ⚙️ Generate auto YouTube video format templates for all 100 problems (title, description, hashtags, tags)?



Which direction do you want next?
